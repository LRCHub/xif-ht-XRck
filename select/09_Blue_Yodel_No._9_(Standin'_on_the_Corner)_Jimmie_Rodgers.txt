Standing on the corner
I didn't mean no harm
Along come a police
He took me by the arm
It was down in Memphis
Corner of Beale and Main
He says "Big boy,
You'll have to tell me your name."
I said "You'll find my name
On the tail of my shirt
I'm a Tennessee hustler
And I don't have to work"
Listen all you rounders,
You better leave my women alone
'Cuz I'll take my Special
And run all you rounders home
My good gal loves me, everybody knows
And she paid a hundred cash dollars
Just for me a suit of clothes.
She come to the joint,
A .44 in each hand
She said "Stand aside all you women and men
'Cause I'm looking for my man."
